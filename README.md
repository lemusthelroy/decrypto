# Decrypto
This app is intended to be a take on the game Decrypto.
## Phase 1 - Create as Companion App
Initially, the app should be focussed on providing the in-game screens to make the game playable, with the app being a 'companion app'. One player per team would have the app on their phone and use it to move through each phase of the game.
## Phase 2 - Convert to Actual Game
Using the screens and logic from Phase 1, the game will then be converted into an actual game that could be played by players independently. Crucially, this will require some kind of basic game engine, a way of inviting players and subscribing to in-game events.
